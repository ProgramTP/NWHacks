                    but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
                    essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with 
                    the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                    PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
